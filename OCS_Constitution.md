## 2. Member Admission

  1. Admission of new members requires approval of all members of all sectors (block of rooms around SK center rooms, framed by controlerless "highway" rooms) that candidate has rooms of.  
  2. The secretary will inform all affected members of such a case. Those members my or may not react on that notification within 3 days (min. 72h). A missing statement means approval of that candidate.  
  3. As soon as all affected members approved a candidate, it may join the alliance.  
  4. If there is a rejection, that candidate may not join until the rejection has been retracted or the candidate relocates all rooms in all sectors which are in common with that rejecting member.  
  5. If the candidate claims any new rooms during the admission process, affecting new sectors, its inhabitants will get notified and asked for approval, as defined in ยง2.2 and a new approval time period starts.  


## 3. Ingame behaviour

  1. Aggressive acts against players of the group (OCS) or any other alliance, as listed on the LOAN map (http://www.leagueofautomatednations.com/map), require consensus of the group.  
  2. Smaller players without membership in an alliance can be harmed or eliminated by individual decision. These are only those players with owned rooms < 4 and GCL < 5.  
  3. Players without membership in an alliance which don't fall into the definition of ยง3.2 may not get harmed, but should get an official invitation for the group at first. The invitation has to be made by either the Community Manager or Group Manager.  
    1. The invited player has a time limit of 5 days to react. The invitation loses liability beyond this limit. Accomodation is still possible after the deadline the but requires consensus of the group.  
    2. The invited player may be target of aggressive actions if he/she does not react within the time limit.  
    3. If the invited player reacts on the invitation and is not joining the alliance he may be harmed/eliminated, unless there are reasons and a consensus of the group not to do so.
