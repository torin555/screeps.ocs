## 1. Charta  
  
1. Each member of the group represents an autonomous individual and is responsible for any of her/his actions alone. 
2. Official declarations, notifications or any official messages made by OCS to OCS members, non OCS members or other groups, must be stated by an official representative of the group only (see 3.5. Representatives). 
3. Aggressive acts by members of OCS against other players or groups may be considered as individual acts by that player, if not announced officially by the OCS *Community Manager* or OCS *Group Manager* (see 3.5. Representatives) prior to the act taking place. 
4. Official announcements made by OCS must at least be (1) made made public to the OCS membership (e.g. using slack) and (2) send to affected non OCS players (e.g. via screeps ingame message) or groups (e.g. via slack or to a representative of that group via ingame message).


## 2. Member Admission

1. Admission of new members requires approval of all members of all sectors (block of rooms around SK center rooms, framed by controlerless "highway" rooms) that candidate has rooms of.  
2. The OCS *Secretary* will inform all affected members of such a case. Those members may or may not react on that notification within 3 days (min. 72h). A missing statement means approval of that candidate.  
3. As soon as all affected members approved a candidate, it may join the alliance.  
4. If there is a rejection, that candidate may not join until the rejection has been retracted or the candidate relocates all rooms in all sectors which are in common with that rejecting member.  
5. If the candidate claims any new rooms during the admission process, affecting new sectors, its inhabitants will get notified and asked for approval, as defined in ยง2.2 and a new approval time period starts.  
6. Candidates must be GCL3 or above. If below this, applicants are welcome to hang out in #ocs, use our public code, contribute, ask questions until they reach GCL3.
